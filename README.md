# Station 1 - SpringBoot
##Introduction
This exercise will introduce you to the productivity gains of using Spring Boot for your Java project.   First we'll use Spring Boot Initializr to create a template Spring Boot applicaiton.  Then we will add a few lines of code to make it a rest end point and then we'll push this applicaiton to Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

### What is Spring Boot Initializr?
Spring Boot Initializr is a fast way to generate a skelton applicaiton and all the necessary dependancies for a spring boot appliciaton.   Visit https://start.spring.io/ and switch into the full version to see the types of applicaitons it can create.

## Setup
Start by cleaning up after the last person and making a directory in your Google Compute Engine Console and changing into it.
```
cd ~
rm -rf springdatarest
mkdir springboot
cd springboot
```

## Download the starter files from start.spring.io
```
curl start.spring.io/starter.zip -o demo.zip -d dependencies=web -d javaVersion=1.7
unzip demo.zip
```

## Look around at the code
The project code that Spring Boot Initializr just created for you.  It expanded out to the following directory structure.  Notice the starter template includes java code, static web templates, and even starter test harnesses for you.

## Add an examplecontroller class
Using vim, emax or nano, which are provided in the GCE console, type in the code in ExampleController.java file above into the  src/main/java/com/example directory.   Or you can avoid typing the code by using the following command to copy it into your environment.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnFunk-Pivotal/CloudBrews-SpringBoot/master/ExampleController.java -o src/main/java/com/example/ExampleController.java
```  

##Build the project and run it
```
mvn clean install
java -jar target/demo*.jar
```

## Open the application in a browser window
http://localhost:8080


##Push the application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry
Finally we'll push this application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, but first we have to login.
```
cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io -u demo1@johnfunk.com -o Channel -s Denver-CloudBrews
cf push bootapp -p target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --random-route
```
If you are asked for a password please ask one of the helpers at the station to proide it.

## Login to Cloud Foundry
Open cloud foundry in a browser by visiting:  http://run.pivotal.io  
   *username: demo1@johnfunk.com  
   *password:  ask one of the helpers  

##Navigate to the Application in Pivotal Cloud Foundry
First click on the 'Denver-CloudBrews' space as shown below:
![CloudFoundrySpace](https://github.com/JohnFunk-Pivotal/CloudBrews-SpringBoot/blob/master/CloudFoundrySpace.png "Space view on PCF")  

Next click on the link under the ROUTE lable as shown below:

## Congradulations
Congratulations you just built a spring boot application on Google Compute Engine and pushed it to Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  Talk to the helper at the station to see what's next!
